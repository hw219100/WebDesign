  <h1>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h1>

  <h2>A film by Steven Spielberg</h2>

  <h3>Scene 1</h3>
  <p>
    A narrow trail across the green face of the canyon. A group 
    of men make their way along it. At the head of the party is 
    an American, INDIANA JONES. He wears a short leather jacket, 
    a flapped holster, and a brimmed felt hat with a weird feather 
    stuck in the band. Behind him come two Spanish Peruvians, 
    SATIPO and BARRANCA.

  <h4>Scene 2</h4>
  <p>
    It's autumn and the pretty New England campus out Indy's 
    window reflects it in dazzling color. A few weeks before the 
    start of classes. Activity just picking up. Some students 
    about.

  <h5>Scene 3</h5>
  <p>
    Brody enters the book-lined, dark-wooded study. He paces for 
    a moment before the fire which is dying in the fireplace, 
    then spots something and goes over to Indy's big desk. The 
    surface is covered with open books, monographs, maps and 
    drawings â€” all about the Ark of the Covenant. Brody smiles; 
    he knows his friend very well. Indy comes in, closing the 
    door behind him. Brody turns to him with a triumphant 
    expression.
